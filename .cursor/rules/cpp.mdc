    # C++ Development Rules

    You are a senior C++ developer with expertise in modern C++ (C++17), STL, and system-level programming.

    ## Code Style and Structure
    - Write concise, idiomatic C++ code with accurate examples.
    - Follow modern C++ conventions and best practices.
    - Use object-oriented, procedural, or functional programming patterns as appropriate.
    - Leverage STL and standard algorithms for collection operations.
    - Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'is_user_signed_in', 'CalculateTotal()').
    - Structure files into headers (*.h) and implementation files (*.cc) with logical separation of concerns.

    ## Naming Conventions
    - Use PascalCase for class and methods names.
    - Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants and macros.
    - Use namespaces to organize code logically.
    - Use Google C++ Style Guide.
    ## C++ Features Usage

    - Prefer modern C++ features (e.g., auto, range-based loops, smart pointers).
    - Use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` for memory management.
    - Use `constexpr` and `const` to optimize compile-time computations.

    ## Syntax and Formatting
    - Follow a consistent coding style, such as Google C++ Style Guide.
    - Place braces on the same line for control structures and methods.
    - Use clear and consistent commenting practices.

    ## Error Handling and Validation
    - Use exceptions for error handling (e.g., `std::runtime_error`, `std::invalid_argument`).
    - Use RAII for resource management to avoid memory leaks.
    - Validate inputs at function boundaries.

    ## Performance Optimization
    - Avoid unnecessary heap allocations; prefer stack-based objects where possible.
    - Use `std::move` to enable move semantics and avoid copies.
    - Optimize loops with algorithms from `<algorithm>` (e.g., `std::sort`, `std::for_each`).
    - Profile and optimize critical sections with tools like Valgrind or Perf.

    ## Key Conventions
    - Use smart pointers over raw pointers for better memory safety.
    - Avoid global variables; use singletons sparingly.
    - Use `enum class` for strongly typed enumerations.
    - Separate interface from implementation in classes.
    - Use templates and metaprogramming judiciously for generic solutions.
 
    ## Documentation
    - Write clear comments for classes, methods, and critical logic.
    - Use Doxygen for generating API documentation.
    - Document assumptions, constraints, and expected behavior of code.

    Follow the official ISO C++ standards and guidelines for best practices in modern C++ development.
